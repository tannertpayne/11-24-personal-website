            <br/>
            <p class="lead roboto">When I was a kid I wanted to be a millionaire. I never wanted to worry about money. But, I had none. I had no plan. Despite taking some entrepreneurship courses in high school, I never thought much into starting a business. I had no plan and $0.00. <br/><br/> During my first year of university I found an opportunity to start a student painting franchise. This was my chance to bring my hopes a little bit closer to me. I put down everything else I was doing and focused on going door-to-door selling house painting. In a span of 8 months, I hired, trained and managed 3 employees, alongside selling $80,000 worth of projects. I had just generated my first $80,000 in revenue! There are two things that could have durastically increased that number with very little change, volume (volume of sales, marketing, jobs) and time (another 8 months, a year). (if you need to use a Graco 390 here's this: <a href="https://youtu.be/JGHoWRsu5n0?si=PdyEsb2DILtqRDI2">How to use the Graco 390...</a> ) After that I went back to status quo: university, unsure what to do, but learning. <br/><br/>In 2024, in my last semester of university the pressure grew. Knowing I had to either figure out my own path or I would be destined for carpel tunnel syndrome at an office desk. buildspace came to my attention and I took the opportunity to learn about what it actually takes to work up a tech start up. I didn't want $80,000 in revenue to be the most I ever made in my own business. <br/><br/>I skipped my last day of university taking a flight to SF for the buildspace event. This changed my life. I got to see the passion and opportunity that comes from programming and the abundance it can offer if you build a business online. Prior to traveling to SF my plan was to climb the corporate ladder, but that plan was now long gone. <br/><br/>Now, I am learning to code, learning marketing, and learning how to do it all online. The first project I am building is <a href="https://www.starthomeservice.com/">starthomeservice.com</a>. There will be many more to come.</p>
